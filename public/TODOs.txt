-------TO DO MASTER LIST-------
-----MINTBEAN CHECKLIST

DONE Your game must be at least as complex as War.

DONE Your game must be played with cards from the standard 52-card deck.

DONE Your game must have a clear win condition. For example, in some games, getting rid of all your cards.

DONE Your game must have a clear lose condition. For example, in some games, scoring the lowest number of points.

DONE (I'M PRAYING?) Accidental duplications of a card will be considered a bug, for which you will lose points. (See the scoring rubric for more details on how bugs affect your score)

-----LOGIC
DONE -Check win condition is working properly for standard last card draw. Not sure if it happening when player hand length is 0 or 1

DONE-Add win condition when WAR occurs at or near the last draw.
SCENARIO: War occurs at or near the last draw. Player1 doesn't hold enough cards in their hand to fully stake the WAR(has less than 5 cards)
  -Option 1 : PlayerOne immediately loses the game

EDGE CASE SCENARIO:
 War occurs at or near the last draw. Player1 and Player2 don't hold enough cards in their hands to fully stake the WAR(both have less than 5 cards). PlayerOne has 3 cards, PlayerTwo has 4 cards. THIS WOULD BE EXCEEDINGLY RARE. It would mean all the cards are staked/'in limbo' from a series of 5 WARS IN A ROW. IS THIS EVEN POSSIBLE?
  
  -The player with the most cards in their hand wins. If players have the same number of cards, The game is a draw

-Add functionality to update the win counts stored in STATE in PlayComponent when a player wins a game.
